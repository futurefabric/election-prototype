<p>Thanks very much for that introduction.</p>

<p>The last CBI event I spoke at was the annual climate change conference, back in November. Under Richard Lambert’s stewardship, the CBI went from strength to strength.</p>

<p>Now there is a new man in charge. And although I’m a little late, I’m delighted to be able to congratulate John publicly on his appointment.</p>

<p>With his experience and commitment to business interests, I know he’ll build on the CBI’s reputation for thoughtful advocacy.</p>

<p>We’re looking to him to keep the green agenda firmly on the table. I’m convinced it’s good for British business.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="why-consumer-behaviour-matters">Why consumer behaviour matters</h3>

<p>The report published today is a good sign. In exploring how we can make the consumer case for low-carbon, it makes a valuable contribution to the debate.</p>

<p>Because consumer behaviour matters. British consumers will spend nearly a trillion pounds this year. What they spend it on - and where - makes a real difference.</p>

<p>70% of our greenhouse gas emissions can be linked to consumer action. So consumers, and the choices they make, will play a huge role in taking carbon out of our economy.</p>

<p>We can’t meet our climate change goals without changing the way we choose goods and services.</p>

<p>Decisions at the till filter up to business planning, and feed back into product development.</p>

<p>At each stage - from design to delivery - there’s a chance to inject a little green thinking.</p>

<p>We should seize that chance.</p>

<p>People feel good about buying things that do good. But in the current environment, we can’t rely on the charitable impulse.</p>

<p>We have to make it easier for people to make green choices. We have to get people thinking green at the critical decision points.</p>

<p>That means making sure there are alternative products that consumers want and need.</p>

<p>That they are signposted and supported by clear and consistent information.</p>

<p>And that they are encouraged by the right blend of regulation, standards and incentives.</p>

<p>Today, I want to look at how we can grow a low-carbon consumer market. And at the roles of government, businesses and consumers in delivering a greener future.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simple question: what affects people’s buying behaviour?</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="tools-available-to-change-it">Tools available to change it</h3>

<p>Firstly, events can change what consumers are looking for, and what producers manufacture.</p>

<p>Take fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>Between 1975 and 1984, the fuel economy of light vehicles in the US rose by 62%. In less than a decade, motor manufacturers used better design to squeeze an extra 7.6 miles per gallon out of domestic vehicles.</p>

<p>This great leap forward was an engineering response to the oil supply and price shocks in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Higher prices at the pumps meant the emphasis shifted toward economy. Petrol was expensive; people wanted more efficient cars; businesses wanted to provide them.</p>

<p>Second, governments can force change by intervening in the market - through regulation, subsidies and standards.</p>

<p>Look at what happened in Europe. A voluntary agreement by car manufacturers wasn’t delivering lower tailpipe emissions. So in 2009, the European Commission stepped in. The Council of Ministers legislated, setting standards for new car emissions.</p>

<p>The result? The cars on our forecourts in 2010 produced 20% less C02 than they did in 2000.</p>

<p>And finally, businesses can drive consumer choice through innovation.</p>

<p>By bringing new products to market, businesses can reframe the options open to consumers - as Toyota did with the Prius.</p>

<p>They made the solution that got people thinking about the problem.</p>

<p>It’s the ‘Field of Dreams’ approach: if you build it, they will come.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="information">Information</h3>

<p>So businesses, governments, and events can all drive choice.</p>

<p>But ultimately, the decision rests with the individual.</p>

<p>We need to get over the barriers stopping consumers from going green.</p>

<p>That means getting past worries about performance or quality of the sustainable option.</p>

<p>It means understanding why some people are reluctant to pay a little more now to save a lot more later.</p>

<p>Buying something because it is green is reason enough for some. But for everyone else, the focus must be on the benefits for consumers.</p>

<p>Like lower energy bills. Improvements in the environment. Better public health.</p>

<p>In tough times, a clear steer on these benefits becomes even more important. So having the right information at hand can make a critical difference.</p>

<p>Take the fuel economy labelling scheme. By bringing together fuel consumption, carbon emissions and estimated fuel costs, the voluntary labelling scheme is a perfect example of how information can affect choice.</p>

<p>Instead of giving people another system of arbitrary categories or another impenetrable dataset, it has a clear rating system and - crucially - a price, in pounds, of running the car for a year.</p>

<p>And it works. 75% of new car buyers said the labels had given them information that influenced their purchase choice.</p>

<p>That’s because it makes the critical connection between carbon and cost. Setting out how much it costs to own a product, rather than simply to buy one.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="real-costs">Real costs</h3>

<p>We also know that people care more about what they pay now rather than what they save in the future.</p>

<p>But we need to get people thinking about price across the lifetime of a product. The key is to make costs real and tangible, rather than abstract.</p>

<p>The labelling scheme makes it easy to factor in fuel costs when you’re buying a car. And with dashboard fuel economy readings, people can easily grasp the running costs of their vehicles.</p>

<p>But although energy ratings on white goods are well understood, there’s little awareness of how much it costs to run a kettle, a TV or a fridge - each day, each year, or each use.</p>

<p>Until you put a price on it, it’s easy to ignore.</p>

<p>But once you tell people that they could save £25 a year by choosing a more efficient fridge/freezer, or £150 over five years by choosing a greener TV, or 6p for every load of washing by using a smarter washing machine - then the smart money is on the green choice.</p>

<p>Suddenly there’s no need to do environmental targeting, because you can let price targeting do the work for you.</p>

<p>But we’re not yet giving customers the chance to make meaningful price comparisons - at least, not consistently across sectors.</p>

<p>So the challenge for household goods manufacturers and retailers is to think about how they can bring the same clarity to their consumer information schemes as the automotive sector.</p>

<p>The government wants to work together with business on this; so let’s get together and start talking about how we can deliver better information for consumers.</p>

<p>Together, we can make it easier for consumers to buy energy efficient products; from providing useful advice in-store and online to developing set of consistent messages.</p>

<p>And a simple, consistent, voluntary labelling system setting out real-world costs can make a real difference.</p>

<p>It can save consumers money, encourage competition on energy efficiency - and refocus consumers on the more sustainable options.</p>

<p>Because at the moment, energy consumption isn’t well understood.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="cost-per-unit">Cost per unit</h3>

<p>And neither is energy supply.</p>

<p>Opaque pricing structures, a cost per unit that most people can’t explain, a lack of real-time information on consumption - the net result is that running costs remain abstract.</p>

<p>That’s where smart meters and the smart grid come in.</p>

<p>Smart meters are about giving consumers the tools to engage with their energy use. We’re finalising plans to roll them out across Britain.</p>

<p>As part of this process we’ve been doing a lot of work with consumers and consumer groups to make sure we get it right. And we’ll be publishing our conclusions shortly.</p>

<p>Smart meters can help people keep an eye on their energy use, and their energy bills. With a quarter of the UK’s carbon emissions coming from the home, that kind of awareness will be critical.</p>

<p>But to really capitalise on smart meters, we also need to look ahead to the next step - enabling consumers to play a more active role in balancing electricity demand.</p>

<p>Two years ago, IBM ran a smart grid pilot project in North Carolina.</p>

<p>With a wireless data connection and a software control panel, they found that homes could save up to 40% of their energy.</p>

<p>Homeowners could check their energy consumption, set daily use profiles, select a monthly target bill amount, and even let the local authority cycle off their appliances during peak times - and all with nothing more than an internet connection.</p>

<p>The right information - presented in a way that allows meaningful comparison - can affect people’s buying behaviour.</p>

<p>Armed with better information, people can make more informed choices - demanding higher standards, driving markets onward, and sparking innovation.</p>

<p>Clearly, information is critical. But who do people trust to provide it?</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="trust">Trust</h3>

<p>Tucked away in the CBI’s report is a graph that makes depressing reading. It asks people which source of information they found most reliable - government, scientists or Which? Magazine.</p>

<p>In the 15-24 age group scientists lead the way, with government close behind.</p>

<p>In middle age, things take a turn for the worse. Trust in government and scientists collapses, and Which? magazine soars ahead.</p>

<p>And by retirement, only one in five people trust government to provide reliable information.</p>

<p>Usually, journalists and politicians are closely matched in the race to the bottom of public opinion.</p>

<p>But when it comes to parting with their cash, people trust the consumer champion to give them the information they’re most likely to use when making a purchasing decision.</p>

<p>We have to overcome this credibility gap - because we’re about to embark on the single biggest intervention in home energy since the birth of the National Grid.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="green-deal">Green Deal</h3>

<p>The Green Deal is our flagship programme to boost the energy efficiency of the UK’s building stock.</p>

<p>It’s a nationwide, self-financing mechanism that allows tenants and homeowners to install energy efficiency measures like cavity wall insulation and loft lagging without paying any upfront costs.</p>

<p>It will be supported by businesses and delivered by partnerships across the country.</p>

<p>Consumers will be engaging with trusted high street brands, who will carry out the advice, installation and financing of Green Deal measures under a Government-appointed accreditation body.</p>

<p>The warning from the CBI’s research is clear: consumer confidence lies outside the reach of government alone.</p>

<p>So we’re looking carefully at exactly how we can best communicate the benefits - and how we can reassure consumers that in this instance, we really are on their side.</p>

<p>We need to make sure the information and messaging is spot on, so that people can clearly see the benefits.</p>

<p>We need to be certain that the accreditation and standards are absolutely rock-solid, so that people know the Green Deal is credible.</p>

<p>And we need to work with businesses to identify innovative - and workable - ways of delivering it.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Today’s report talks about businesses having a responsibility to inform consumers about green choices.</p>

<p>But with great responsibility comes great opportunity.</p>

<p>The low-carbon and environmental goods and services sector is vast; £3.2 trillion and counting, with growth predicted to outstrip world GDP. Those who move first, and move fast, stand to make huge gains.</p>

<p>In setting coherent standards and giving people the means make informed choices, businesses can create a vibrant marketplace in which to prosper.</p>

<p>Through the Green Deal and smart meters we have a unique opportunity to engage people with the way they use energy - and what the consequences are.</p>

<p>It’s also a chance to change the story on green products. Rather than a sacrifice you make to feel better about yourself, we can make it clear that the green choice is also the smart choice.</p>

<p>On information, standards and innovation, we can begin to reframe the way consumers make choices, ushering a new concept of value.</p>

<p>One that takes account of the lifetime costs and carbon consequences of a product.</p>

<p>In so doing, we can make a very real contribution to the UK’s energy and climate change ambitions.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. </p>
