        <h2 style="font-size:24px;">This blog post is from a previous government</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:400;">
        It was published under the 2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p><strong><a href="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/portland.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-497 size-large" src="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/portland-620x413.jpg" alt="Outwood Academy Portland: pupil at work" width="620" height="413" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outwood Academy Portland was among the lowest performing schools in the country over 2 years ago but is now rated outstanding by Ofsted &#8211; one of the quickest turnarounds ever achieved. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Principal Dr Philip Smith explains how the Worksop school has taken advantage of academy freedoms to improve pupils&#8217; attainment.</strong></p>
<p>The school was one of the most challenging in the country when Outwood Grange Academies Trust first started working with it in December 2010.</p>
<p>The freedom provided by academy status has allowed us to continue to put students first.</p>

<h2>Outwood philosophy</h2>
<p>The ethos, achievement and self-belief of both students and staff has changed dramatically and Portland now exemplifies the Outwood philosophy of ‘the whole point of schools is that children come first and everything we do must reflect this single goal’.</p>
<p>Portland has become a beacon of outstanding practice, illustrating how the Outwood model can impact so significantly on children.</p>
<h2><a href="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/3girlsaxs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-460 size-large" src="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/3girlsaxs-620x494.jpg" alt="Outwood Academy Portland: girls play saxophones" width="620" height="494" /></a></h2>
<h2>School day</h2>
<p>We start teaching period 1 at 8:25am, this gives a lot of pace to the day and allows us to finish the taught day at 2:30pm.</p>
<p>From 2:30 to 3:30pm we offer optional, enrichment sessions for students; over 100 sessions take place weekly, with almost 70% of students staying for at least one.</p>
<p><a href="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/PORTLANDSPORT.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-480 " src="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/PORTLANDSPORT-310x466.jpg" alt="Pupil runs the hurdles race." width="284" height="426" /></a>These cover a complete range of activities. These include academic catch-up sessions, music/drama clubs and homework clubs, to gaming clubs, sports teams and creative opportunities.</p>
<p>Some students stay every night, so we try to encourage them to get involved in as broad a range as possible, especially if it means moving out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Attending a regular activity is 1 of the 10 pledges that we ask students to achieve before they start post-16 courses.</p>
<p>The pledges are a great way to ensure students develop rounded skills, as they consist of such a broad range of challenges that everyone finds they have developed in areas where they never thought they could.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t altered our school year, as it is important that we match our holidays with the primary schools.</p>
<p>So not only do older students have the opportunity to spend time with younger siblings but also avoid causing any issues for our parents and carers by having different holiday periods.</p>
<p>We all know how important family time is in dealing with the pressures that students have these days, and it is something we take very seriously.<a href="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/outside-schl.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-470 size-large" src="https://academyschools.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2015/01/outside-schl-620x414.jpg" alt="Outwood Academy Portland" width="620" height="414" /></a></p>
<h2>Life-changing</h2>
<p>The majority of families are overjoyed at the quality of education we provide, and are full of praise.</p>
<p>This is especially true if they had other children who attended Portland before it became an Outwood academy, as they can draw direct comparisons between the two phases.</p>
<p>The most obvious impact we have had is evident in the change in exam results.</p>
<p>Before becoming an academy, the highest the school had ever achieved was 41% 5A* toC GCSE results, including English and maths. However, over the last 2 years, it has been above 75%.</p>
<p>We are particularly proud that this year, in 2014, 73% of our pupil premium students achieved 5A* to C including English and maths, which shows that the most disadvantaged students are gaining life-changing qualifications that lead to improved confidence, self-belief and a very bright future.</p>

<h2>Tried and tested</h2>
<p>My advice to principals/head teachers and their governing bodies who are considering becoming an academy is to discuss with the Department for Education, or, regional schools commissioner, the advantages of being part of a successful academy trust.</p>
<p>Your school would be part of a successful trust with a tried and tested model which would allow you to concentrate on what matters most – the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom.</p>
